## Blockchain based Identity cards.

### Motivation: 
Identity fraud and theft is one of the most common crimes that costs millions of dollars to the government, banks and institutions, also posing a threat to national security. Artificial Intelligence solutions are being used to create facial recognition systems to identify and tag people but it has raised a lot of suspicion and scrutiny among people. 

### Solution: 

Creating blockchain based ledgers for passports attached with rap-sheet and documents of a person. Our approach is to create individual blocks of a person’s identity equipped with immutable documents issued by an authority. To understand it better, let’s take an example of a person who has been to jail 3 times, is a suspect in a crime and is trying to flee the country using a forged passport. Conditions like these wouldn’t arrive ever because the passport is immutable and unchangeable, here are some cases how it might play out. 

Case 1: 
He tries to hide his crime history and tries to quietly leave the country. Under normal conditions he would succeed ⅗ times or maybe rarely, but if it were to be recorded on his life’s ledger he wouldn’t be able to book tickets because his passport is linked with his rap-sheet, all present on our platform. 

Case 2: 
He tries to forge the passport, carry a fake passport etc. The passport will be scanned and immediately detected as fraud/fake as it is not present on the ledger.

### How does this work?

Blockchain is the technology driving the solution. Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. It is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.
